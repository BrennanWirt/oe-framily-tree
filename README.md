## What is this?

This is an interactive family tree for the Omicron Epsilon Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at Western Carolina University. 
This project was forked from Nate Fischer's Wonderful [Framily Tree project.](https://github.com/nfischer/framily-tree)

This family tree is entirely data-driven and easy to update. Data is pulled from
a [google spreadsheet].

## Why?

Previous Iterations of Omicron Epsilon's family tree were very clunky, ugly, and difficuly to maintain or update.
As the Historian, I wanted to take better care of the family tree and make it more appealing to index and learn from.
This is also a long term solution, as the [google spreadsheet] is contained within the chapter's Google account.

## How does it work?

Check out the [design overview](https://github.com/nfischer/framily-tree/wiki/Design).

## Maintaining this family tree

Updating the data? Adding new members to the tree? See the instructions
[here](https://github.com/nfischer/framily-tree/wiki/Updating-data-(adding-new-members)).
